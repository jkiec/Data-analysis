# Data-analysis
The repository icludes projects that I completed as part of the Udemy courses: "Microsoft Excel: Business Intelligence w/ Power Query & DAX" and "Microsoft Power BI Desktop for Business Intelligence". The projects present data analysis using Excel and Microsoft Power BI. As part of the projects:
- I used ETL process using Power Query to prepare data,
- I built a relational data model,
- I added calculations using DAX,
- I analyzed the data using Power Pivot (project 1)
- I created a dynamic interactive report (project 2).
