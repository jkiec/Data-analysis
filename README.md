# Data-analysis
The repository icludes projects that I completed as part of the Udemy courses: "Microsoft Excel: Business Intelligence w/ Power Query & DAX" and "Microsoft Power BI Desktop for Business Intelligence". The projects present data analysis using Excel and Microsoft Power BI. As part of the projects:
- I used ETL process using Power Query to prepare data,
- I built a relational data model,
- I added calculations using DAX,
- I analyzed the data using Power Pivot (project 1)
- I created a dynamic interactive report (project 2).

The goals of the projects were:
- KPI tracking (project 2),
- regional performance comparison,
- trends analysis at the product level,
- high-value customers identification (project 2).
